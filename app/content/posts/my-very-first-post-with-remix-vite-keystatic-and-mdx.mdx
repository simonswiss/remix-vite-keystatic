This post is powered by the experimental MDX field in Keystatic. Go ahead and [edit it in the Admin UI](/keystatic/collection/posts/item/my-very-first-post-with-remix-vite-keystatic-and-mdx).

## Let's try a Card component

<Card
  title="This is my first card"
  body="Whoaaaa, this is actually pretty cool! This card has no image."
/>

This is a custom `Card` MDX component below. The code output looks like this:

```
<Card
  title="This is my first card"
  body="Whoaaaa, this is actually pretty cool! This card has no image."
/>
```

A `Card` can also have an optional image (stored on the file system via Keystatic):

<Card
  image="/images/posts/my-very-first-post-with-remix-vite-keystatic-and-mdx/20220404_072620.jpg"
  title="Another card"
  body="Yesssssss, let's go"
/>

## How about an inline stack of cards?

<InlineStack gap={24}>
  <Card
    title="My first card"
    body="This is the first card. Those will wrap inside the inline-stack."
  />
  <Card title="Another card" body="Yesssssss, let's go" />
  <Card title="I can go on all day" body="You get the idea" />
  <Card title="One more" body="I think this is pretty cool." />
  <Card title="Okay one last one" body="Yesssssss, let's go" />
</InlineStack>

A `wrapper` component is used for these, with multiple `Card` component `blocks` nested inside. The MDX output for those looks like this:

```
<InlineStack gap={32}>
  <Card title="My first card" body="This is the first card" />
  <Card title="Another card" body="Yesssssss, let's go" />
  <Card title="I can go on all day" body="You get the idea" />
  <Card title="One more" body="Yesssssss, let's go" />
  <Card title="Okay one last one" body="Yesssssss, let's go" />
</InlineStack>
```
